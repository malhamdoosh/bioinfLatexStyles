However, they also show that theestimators they derive suffer from bias.  In this letter we derivedifferent estimators from the same model and show these estimators tobe preferable.\citeN{Rannalaetal2000}   write the log likelihood function for allelefrequencies $\bp=(p_1,\ldots,p_k)$ and infection rate$\lambda$ as \begin{equation}\ell = -n \log(1-e^{-\lambda}) + \sum_{j=1}^k\{z_j \log(1-e^{-\lambda p_j}) - (n-z_j)\lambda p_j\}\label{eq:loglike}\end{equation}where $z_j$ is the number of sampled hosts infected bybacteria with allele $j$, $j=1,\ldots,k$, and where $n$ is the totalnumber of {\em infected} hosts sampled.  Then, although they note that amore rigorous statistical approach would be to find estimators bymaximizing the likelihood jointly over the parameters $\bp$ and$\lambda$, they employ an heuristic maximization method to derive theirestimators.  Their method does not obtain the maximum likelihoodestimators for $\bp$ and $\lambda$, because it does not properly accountfor the constraint that the allele frequencies sum to unity. The true maximum likelihood estimators (MLE's) may be found by performingthe constrained optimization by the method of LaGrange multipliers.  Weshow this below.  The MLE's derived this way are shown to befar less biased than the estimators given in \citeN{Rannalaetal2000}. Additionally, weshow that if data are available on both infected and uninfected hosts, then it ispreferable to use all that information to estimate $\bp$ and$\lambda$, rather than using only the data on infected hosts. \section{Constrained Optimization}Any values of $\bp$ and $\lambda$ which maximize(\ref{eq:loglike}) while satisfying the constraint $\sum_{j=1}^k p_j =1$,will also be maximizers of the equation\begin{equation}\LLL = -n \log(1-e^{-\lambda}) + \sum_{j=1}^k\{z_j \log(1-e^{-\lambda p_j}) - (n-z_j)\lambda p_j\} + \mu(\sum_{j=1}^k p_j - 1)\label{eq:LaGrange}\end{equation}where $\mu$ is an arbitary non-zero constant ($\mu$ is called the``LaGrange multiplier" in this context).  The MLE's may be foundby setting the first partial derivatives of (\ref{eq:LaGrange}) withrespect to $\bp$ and$\lambda$ equal to zero and solving for $\bp$, $\lambda$ and $\mu$.  Thuswe have\begin{eqnarray}0 = \frac{\partial\LLL}{\partial p_j} & = &\frac{z_j \lambda e^{-\lambdap_j} }{1-e^{-\lambda p_j}} - (n - z_j)\lambda + \mu~~~~~~~,~~~~~~j =1,\ldots, k \label{eq:dbyp}\\0 = \frac{\partial\LLL}{\partial \lambda} & = & \frac{-ne^{-\lambda} }{1-e^{-\lambda}} + \sum_{j=1}^k  p_j\biggl\{\frac{z_j  e^{-\lambdap_j} }{1-e^{-\lambda p_j}} - (n - z_j) \biggr\}. \label{eq:dbylambda}\end{eqnarray}By adding and subtracting terms of$(p_j\mu)/ \lambda$, (\ref{eq:dbylambda}) may be rewritten as \begin{equation}0 = \frac{\partial\LLL}{\partial \lambda}  =  \frac{-ne^{-\lambda} }{1-e^{-\lambda}} + \sum_{j=1}^k  p_j\biggl\{\frac{z_j  e^{-\lambdap_j} }{1-e^{-\lambda p_j}} - (n - z_j) + \frac{\mu}{\lambda} \biggr\} -\sum_{j=1}^k \frac{p_j \mu}{\lambda}.\label{eq:subtle}\end{equation}In (\ref{eq:subtle}), the part in curly braces is equal to$\frac{1}{\lambda}\frac{\partial\LLL}{\partial p_j}$, which isequal to zero.  So, we may solve for $\mu$:\begin{eqnarray}0 & =  & \frac{-ne^{-\lambda} }{1-e^{-\lambda}}  - \frac{ \mu}{\lambda} \nonumber  \\\mu & = & \frac{-\lambda n e^{-\lambda}}{1-e^{-\lambda}}. \nonumber\end{eqnarray}By substituting this value for $\mu$ into (\ref{eq:dbyp}) the MLE for$p_j$ is found to be \begin{equation}\hat{p}_j = -\frac{1}{\lambda} \log\biggl( \frac{ n/(1-e^{-\lambda}) -z_j}{n/(1-e^{-\lambda})}\biggr)~~~~~~,~~~~~~j = 1,\ldots,k\label{eq:phat}\end{equation}and the MLE for $\lambda$ follows from the fact that the $p_j$ sum toone\begin{equation}\hat{\lambda} = -\sum_{j=1}^k \log \biggl( \frac{ n/(1-e^{-\lambda}) -z_j}{n/(1-e^{-\lambda})}\biggr).\label{eq:lambdahat}\end{equation}The system of equations (\ref{eq:phat}) and (\ref{eq:lambdahat}) cannotbe solved explicitly, but it is straightforward to find $\hat\bp$and $\hat{\lambda}$ iteratively to arbitrary precision.  For reasons that willbecome clear shortly, we call theseestimators the {\em partial sample MLE's}.When $\lambda$ is large, so that most of the sampled hosts are infected,this MLE will differ little from the estimator derived by\citeN{Rannalaetal2000}, since $1-e^{-\lambda}$ will be very close to onein that case. It will differ more from the estimator in\citeN{Rannalaetal2000} when $\lambda$ is small  and many of the hostssampled are not infected by any bacteria.  We have empirically found that this MLE usually gives estimates that arebetween the estimates from \citeANP{Rannalaetal2000}'s estimator and the ``uncorrectedestimates"  of $z_j/\sum_{i=1}^k z_i$.  The MLE does not fall between the othertwo estimators only at alleles for which all three estimators give very similar frequency estimates.Hence, while the uncorrected estimator used in \citeN{Wangetal1999} and\citeN{Qiuetal1997} tends to overestimate low-frequency alleles and underestimatehigh-frequency alleles, the estimator proposed by \citeN{Rannalaetal2000} over-correctsthe problem, underestimating low-frequency alleles and overestimating high frequencyalleles.  As our simulations show, the estimators we propose don't suffer from thisbias.  Before we jump to the next section, we will demonstrate several different heading levels:\Genetics2level{Genetics 2nd-Level Section Heading}This section level heading is apparently seldom used by anyone or anything in {\emGenetics} (according to their own account on their website.  You invoke it with thecommand $\backslash$\texttt{Genetics2level}.  It is better to use the other twosubheadings:\subsection{The Subsection Heading:}This pleasing little subheading is obtained with a $\backslash$\texttt{subsection}command.  It is most commonly used as a second-level heading beneath the centered,small-caps heading.  You have to add your own colon!!\subsubsection{The lowest-level subheading:}  This is the lowest-level subheading whichis obtained with the $\backslash$\texttt{subsubsection} command.  Once again, you haveto add your own colon.  \section{Estimation from the whole sample of hosts}The quantity $n/(1-e^{-\lambda})$ can be seen to estimate the total numberof hosts sampled, both infected and uninfected.  In fact, it is possibleto improve the estimation of $\bp$ and$\lambda$ by including information (if available) on the numberof uninfected, as well as infected hosts sampled.  Since \citeN{Rannalaetal2000} use only the infected hosts, their log-likelihood(\ref{eq:loglike}) contains the term $-n\log(1-e^{-\lambda})$ which arises fromconditioning upon the hosts being infected.  If one uses the information in bothinfected and uninfected hosts, that term vanishes from the log-likelihood.   Doing so, and letting$M$ denote the total number of hosts (infected and uninfected) sampled, thelog-likelihood becomes\[\ell = \sum_{j=1}^k\{z_j \log(1-e^{-\lambda p_j}) - (M-z_j)\lambda p_j\}.\]Since the $p_j$ and $\lambda$ only occur together as the products$\lambda p_j$ in this expression, the unconstrained maximizationprocedure pursued by \citeANP{Rannalaetal2000} would be appropriate, and itfollows that the MLE's (which we will call the {\em complete sample MLE's}) are\begin{eqnarray}\hat{p}_j & = &  -\frac{1}{\lambda} \log\biggl( \frac{ M- z_j}{M}\biggr)~~~~~~,~~~~~~j = 1,\ldots,k\label{eq:phatU}    \\\hat{\lambda} & = & -\sum_{j=1}^k \log \biggl( \frac{ M -z_j}{M}\biggr).\label{eq:lambdahatU}\end{eqnarray}These expressions are identical to those in \citeN{Rannalaetal2000} except that $M$ isused in place of $n$. If $M$, the total number of hosts sampled, is available, these arethe preferred estimators for two reasons.  First, being available in closedform, it is not necessary to iteratively compute the complete sample MLE's   as it is forthe partial sample MLE's.  And second, it can be shown that if $M$ is known, and$\lambda$ unkown, then $M$ and the set of $z_j$ ($j=1,\ldots,k$) are the minimalsufficient statistics for the parameters$\lambda$ and $\bp$. Since $M$ is not a deterministic function of $n$ it follows fromthe definition of minimal sufficiency that$n$ and the set of $z_j$ $(j=1,\ldots,k)$ are not sufficient for $\lambda$and $\bp$,  and so the partial sample MLE is not based on all the available informationunless the investigator failed to record or does not actually know $M$.  Sinceestimators based on sufficient statistics typically have smaller variance than thosethat are not based on sufficient statistics, the complete sample MLE should be used when$M$ is known.  Of course, if only $n$ and the $z_j$'s are known, then, in that context,the partial sample MLE {\em is} based on the sufficient statistic and should be used. Simulations (Figure~\ref{fig:VarGraph}) confirm that the complete sample MLE has lowervariance than the partial sample MLE.Programs to compute the partial sample and complete sample MLE's described above maybe downloaded from \texttt{http://www.rannala.org}.  \section{Simulations and Data}We have repeated a small set of simulations like those carried out in\citeN{Rannalaetal2000}.   Briefly, hosts were infected at rate $\lambda=2$ by $k=3$different allelic types.  Hostswere sampled from this population until $n=100$ infected hosts had been sampled.  Thetotal number,$M$, of hosts sampled to achieve 100 infected ones was also recorded for each simulatedsample so that we could compute the complete sample MLE.  Simulations were done for ninedifferent sets of allele frequencies in which $p_1$ was taken from $\{.1,.2,\ldots,.9\}$ and $p_2=p_3=.5(1-p_1)$.  For each set ofallele frequencies, 50,000 replicate samples were drawn and the various estimators werecomputed for each one.  Occasionally, when $p_1$ was large, a sample would bedrawn with $z_1 = n$.  In such a case the partial sample MLE is undefined, andso we discarded these samples (thus, 9 were discarded when $p_1=.8$ and 1483 when$p=.9$).  The results are summarized in Figures~\ref{fig:BiasVar}and~\ref{fig:VarGraph}.  They demonstrate that the MLE's we have derived here are muchless biased than the estimators given in \citeN{Rannalaetal2000}, and they demonstratethat the variance of the complete sample MLE is smaller than that of the partial sampleMLE (albeit only slightly for $\lambda=2$). We have also reanalyzed the tick data given in Table~1 of \citeN{Rannalaetal2000} usingthe partial sample MLE.  Our estimates of the allele frequencies for all of thealleles at {\em ospA} and all of the alleles except allele~D at {\em ospC} wereintermediate to the ``uncorrected estimate" and the \citeANP{Rannalaetal2000}estimate.  The three different estimates for allele~D at {\em ospC} differed only atthe fourth decimal place.  Our method estimates that the {\em Borrelia burgdorferi}allele frequencies are somewhat more uniform than inferred by \citeN{Rannalaetal2000}.\begin{figure}\begin{center}\mbox{\subfigure[Estimate of Lambda]{\includegraphics*[width = .4\textwidth]	{LambdaGraph.eps}} \hspace*{.1\textwidth}\subfigure[Standardized Bias]{\includegraphics*[width = .4\textwidth]	{BiasGraph.eps}}}\end{center}\caption{Figures from simulations like those in \protect\citeN{Rannalaetal2000} for thecase$\lambda = 2$.  ``R" indicates the estimator from\protect\citeANP{Rannalaetal2000}\  ``P" denotes the partial sample MLE(Equations~\ref{eq:phat} and~\ref{eq:lambdahat}), and ``C" denotes the complete sampleMLE (Equations~\ref{eq:phatU} and~\ref{eq:lambdahatU}).
